# Unity-Space-Game
This is an in-progress (development haulted until I get more free time..) space game made for Unity, coded in C#.
<br>
Everything except for GridOverlay.cs was coded by me, Matthew Breden.

A video of how it all works is available <a href="http://plays.tv/s/Kjgaumg3boiI">right here.</a>
