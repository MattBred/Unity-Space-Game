# Unity-Space-Game
This is an in-progress (development haulted until I get more free time..) space game made for Unity, coded in C#.
<br>
Everything except for GridOverlay.cs was coded by me, Matthew Breden.
<br><br>
A video of how it all works is available <a href="http://plays.tv/s/Kjgaumg3boiI">right here.</a> (Mind the funky physics.. Unity can be funny with that.)
<br><br>
What's important to note here is that nothing is really supplied scripting-wise for Unity. Every aspect of the game was handled through scripts I wrote. The camera, how the GUI works, placing ship components, the electrical panel, etc.
